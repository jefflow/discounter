# Discounter
## About this app
Discounter is one of my first "real" iOS app development projects, hence the bare-bones codebase, lack of interesting features, and simple idea. This app is meant to get my feet wet with iOS app development and hopefully more will come. 

## What does it do?
All it does for now is that it shows the final sale price after applying a discount to an item. That's it. This app idea was inspired by how bad my math skills are.

## Future Plans
- Use CoreData or Realm so the user can keep track of the discounts they entered on a seperate view.
- Use CoreLocation so the user can include the current location's sales tax in the final sales price.
- Enable widget functionality.
- Add home screen actions.
- Experiment with custom interfaces.
